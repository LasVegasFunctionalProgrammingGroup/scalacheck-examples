===================

Examples of property-based testing with ScalaCheck, and using ScalaCheck with ScalaTest

To get started, clone the repo and do `sbt test`.

This compiles and executes the tests in `src/test/scala`, which are the bulk of the repository.

There is also some Java code in `src/java` that is also tested using ScalaTest/ScalaCheck.
